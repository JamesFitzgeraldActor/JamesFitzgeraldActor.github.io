                        <div class="quote">I had always held David Thewlis’ portrayal of this character — in the 2000 film version directed by Conor McPherson — as the best I’ve ever seen, but FitzGerald achieves a level of insouciant resignation which surpasses that performance and begins to approach the rarified landscape of silent film masters such as Buster Keaton. His repetitions, and there are many written into the play, such as the ladder sequences, are never banal. You see the same action performed again and again, but it always looks organic. Like Keaton, like Chaplin, we watch this character with fascination, even though we know, in the classic definition of “The Clown” he will never advance the action. But we hear his steps like heartbeats which may never amount to anything, but infuse the room with life, even if it has no purpose.</div>

I shouldn’t wonder that PICT chose to do the play primarily because Mr. FitzGerald was available to play it.</div>
